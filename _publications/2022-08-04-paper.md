Abstract: Dynamical systems across many disciplines are modeled as interacting particles or agents, with interaction rules that depend on a very small number of variables (e.g. pairwise distances, pairwise differences of phases, etc...), functions of the state of pairs of agents. Yet, these interaction rules can generate self-organized dynamics, with complex emergent behaviors (clustering, flocking, swarming, etc.). We propose a learning technique that, given observations of states and velocities along trajectories of the agents, yields both the variables upon which the interaction kernel depends and the interaction kernel itself, in a nonparametric fashion. This yields an effective dimension reduction which avoids the curse of dimensionality from the high-dimensional observation data (states and velocities of all the agents). We demonstrate the learning capability of our method to a variety of first-order interacting systems.
