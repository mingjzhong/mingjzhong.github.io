I work on various kinds of inverse problems related to scientific machine leanring:
1. Learing Self Organization from Observation
1. Physics Informed Machine Learning for Solving and Learning PDEs

Learning Dynamics
======
We have developed a learning framework to explain self organization (also known as collective behavior) from observation data.  A summary presentation of the research can be found [here](https://youtu.be/vmfKFZoFt4s), and a webinar on this topic can be found [here](https://youtu.be/yc-AIAEtGDc).

Physics Informed Machine Learning
======
We have developed a series of training schemes for solving PDE driven dynamics using Physics Informed Neural Networks as well as Physics Informed Gaussian Processes.  An overview of the research can be found [here](https://youtu.be/1SuSrQcpiy4), and a webinar on this topic can be found [here](https://youtu.be/sD9NTHiWTIQ).
