I work on various kinds of inverse problems related to scientific machine leanring:
1. Learing Self Organization from Observation
1. Physics Informed Machine Learning for Solving and Learning PDEs

Learning Collective Behaviors
======
We have developed series of variational inverse problem based learning methods to explain collective behaviors (also known as self organization), such as clustering, flocking, swarming, and synchronization,  from observation data.  A summary presentation of the research can be found [here](https://youtu.be/vmfKFZoFt4s), a follow up presentation can be found [here](https://youtu.be/3OSb1gya7g4), and a webinar on this topic can be found [here](https://youtu.be/yc-AIAEtGDc).

Physics Informed Machine Learning
======
We have developed a series of training schemes for solving PDE driven dynamics using Physics Informed Neural Networks as well as Physics Informed Gaussian Processes.  An overview of the research can be found [here](https://youtu.be/1SuSrQcpiy4), and a webinar on this topic can be found [here](https://youtu.be/sD9NTHiWTIQ).
